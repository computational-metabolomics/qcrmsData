Description: This package contains subset of LC-MS data files in mzML format.
    Subset of Thermo .Raw data files of MTBLS404 study from MetaboLights data
    repository was downloaded on May 14, 2020. 36 data files were selected,
    16 from batch 1 and 16 from batch 2. 12 QC samples are evenly distributed
    across measured analytical batches and selected biological samples.
    RAW data files were converted into mzML file format using msconvert tool
    from Proteowizard suite v3.0.20134-da94b986e. Profile mode data were
    centroided using msconvert peak picking filter and Vendor algorithm option.
    Subset filter of the msconvert tool was used to subset spectra in the 
    interval of 300 to 500 seconds.
